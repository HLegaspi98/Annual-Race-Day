Description: 
The Annual Race Day script is a simple JavaScript program designed to assign race numbers and times
for participants in a race event. Based on the runner's age and time of registration, the script will determine
their race number and start time. The program prioritizes conditional logic, random number generation, 
and flow control to handle different scenarios for participants.

Potential Enhancements: 
1) Accept user input for age and registration status as opposed to hard-coding values by the use of random number generation.
2) Implement a full-stack application incorporating UI for user-friendly interaction.
3) Expand the logic to handle different race categories or distances.
