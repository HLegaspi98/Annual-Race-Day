The Annual Race Day script is a simple JavaScript program designed to assign race numbers and times
for participants in a race event. Based on the runner's age and time of registration, the script will determine
their race number and start time. The program prioritizes conditional logic, random number generation, 
and flow control to handle different scenarios for participants.
